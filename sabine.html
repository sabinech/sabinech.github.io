<h1> ALL ABOUT ME </h1>
<h2>  Sabine Charles </h2>

BIO: Hi my name is Sabine Charles I am from Stamford Connecticut. I live with my Dad, Mom, Two older sisters, a younger brother, my grandma (on my dads side), and my aunt.
I have an incredibly large family. I was born on May 10th 2002, which means I'm a taurus. Both my parents and thier families are immagrants from Haiti.
family means everything to me, we do almost everything together.
 I am going to be a junior at Stamford High in the fall, and looking forward to it.
 I have always been intrested in mysterys and solving cases. Finding out who did it before the detectives do or those plot twist endings are always fun.
